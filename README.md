# Introduction
This project is a web interface for Active Directory made using Flask and
python-ldap, focusing on ease of use and simplicity.

It's using the connecting user's credentials to connect to the
directory and allow a variety of operations.

The goal is to be able to do most common directory operations directly
through this web interface rather than have to rely on command tools or
Windows interfaces.

It's compatible with both Windows Active Directory and Samba4 domain controllers.

# History
This project started as a fork of samba4-manager, created by St√©phane Graber
and the Edubuntu community.
Was used internally at Havana's Technology University in 2017, and since it has 
received numerous updates, additions, and changes.
We decided to release our version publicly since the original project was not being
regularly updated. It has grown since to a much more capable application.
The project is now maintained by [GSoft Innovation](https://www.gsoftinnovation.com/en/).
We will keep updating the project for our organization and the community,
and we are open to all kinds of feedback and contributions.

# Install and run

Note: all code has only been tested and it's supported to run on Linux systems, contributions
regarding compatibility with other platforms is welcomed. 

## Local config

 * Create settings.py to configure
 * Put a random string in SECRET\_KEY
 * Set LDAP\_DOMAIN to your Directory domain
 * Set SEARCH\_DN to your Directory LDAP search base
 * Set LDAP\_SERVER to your Domain Controller IP
 * Use DEBUG = True if you want the test server to immediately reload after changes
 * ADD to TREE\_BLACKLIST the containers you want to hide in the root directory
 * Set ADMIN\_GROUP to the security group with read/write permission (default should be Domain Admins)
 * Add attribute pairs to SEARCH\_ATTRS and TREE\_ATTRIBUTES to customize the tree view
 * Use the USE_LDAPS = True if you want the work on LDAPS protocol(636) (the default set to LDAP, 389 Port)

### Settings.py example:

```python
class Settings:
    SECRET_KEY = "AHDGIWIWBQSBKQYUQXBXKGAsdhahdflkjfgierqhs"
    LDAP_DOMAIN = "cujae.edu.cu"
    SEARCH_DN = "dc=cujae,dc=edu,dc=cu"
    LDAP_SERVER = "10.8.1.63"
    DEBUG = True
    # URL_PREFIX = "/domain"
    TREE_BLACKLIST = [
        "CN=ForeignSecurityPrincipals", "OU=sudoers", "CN=Builtin",
        "CN=Infrastructure", "CN=LostAndFound", "CN=Managed Service Accounts",
        "CN=NTDS Quotas", "CN=Program Data", "CN=System",
        "OU=Domain Controllers"
    ]
    ADMIN_GROUP = "Domain Admins"
    SEARCH_ATTRS = [('sAMAccountName', 'Username'), ('givenName', 'Name')]
    TREE_ATTRIBUTES = [['mail', "Email"], ['__type', "Type"], ['active', "Status"]]
```

You can install the dependencies using pip and the supplied requirements.txt. Especial 
consideration to the python-ldap dependency, which depends on native C libraries and as such needs
native compilers and tooling to be installed ([check python-ldap docs here](https://www.python-ldap.org/en/python-ldap-3.4.0/installing.html#build-prerequisites)).

## Installing dependencies in Ubuntu 20.04 (Recommended distro)

```sh
apt update
apt install python3-venv python3-pip
apt install build-essential python3-dev libldap2-dev libsasl2-dev slapd ldap-utils tox lcov valgrind
python3 -m venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 ADwebmanager.py
```

You may then connect through [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
